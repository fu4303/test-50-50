			<h1>Eleven Madison Park</h1>
<h2>New York, USA</h2>

<div class="article-intro">
  <h3 class="article-date">July 16, 2018</h3>
  <p>Eleven Madison Park was the 3rd restaurant on the quest. It was ranked № 1 in 2017 and fell ever so slightly to 4th in 2018. Eleven is also a Michelin 3-star restaurant.</p>
</div>

<p>As you might imagine, getting reservations means planning ahead. Reservations for a given month open up on the 1st of the previous month. For our July reservation, we booked June 1st. The rest of the restaurants were planned around this one.</p>

<p>The service from the moment we walked in the door was fantastic. Our host was cheerful and friendly throughout the meal.</p>

<p>The food. Oh my god, the food. The meal was incredible. I was nearly to tears with how good the food was.</p>

<p>Most of the dishes have a seasonal twist on them. Being in the thick of summer, corn was a common thread through some of the courses. Caviar served on top of a corn soufflé with a cream sauce, for example, was fantastic.</p>

<blockquote><p>Chef Daniel Humm himself said, “The duck is probably the only recipe that I feel I have perfected fully.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And it was fantastic. I highly recommend choosing the duck option, if you have the chance.</p>

<p>By far my favourite dish was the foie gras. Absolute perfection. Each bite was bliss and I savoured it through and through. Nothing I’ve had before or since compares to this dish.</p>

<p>One other interesting tidbit was that we prepaid for our meal when we made the booking. This actually made the end of the meal quite pleasant. There was nothing to sign and no large bill to pretend wasn’t some insanely large amount. It also meant not feeling uncomfortable about how much to tip. I wish more restaurants did this.</p>

<p>Verdict: Worth it. I will fly around the world to go here.</p>

      <h2>The Quest</h2>

      <p>In 2018, shortly after my 44th birthday, I set myself a goal to visit 50 of the 
        World's 50 Best Restaurants before I turn 50.</p> 
      <p>A new list comes out every year, with new restaurants added to the list and some restaurants falling off the list. I can visit any restaurant that was on the list between 2017 and 2022. </p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>I love to travel and I love great food. The list provides an excuse to travel to new places around the world all while enjoying some of the best food on the planet.</p>
