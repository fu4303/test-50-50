			<h1>Cosme</h1>
<h2>New York, USA</h2>

<div class="article-intro">
  <h3 class="article-date">July 15, 2018</h3>
  <p>Cosme was the 2nd restaurant on the quest. It was ranked 40th in 2017 and jumped to 25th in 2018.</p>
</div>

<p>Cosme serves up “fresh Mexican cuisine from one of the hottest young chefs in the US”, Daniela Soto-Innes.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of tasting menus where everything is decided for you—including the drink pairing. Cosme only does a la carte small plates, so I was overwhelmed with what to choose. If you can go as a group of four, I think that’d be ideal. That way, everybody can order a couple different things and share.</p>

<p>Even still, Cosme was wonderful. The place was busy but you can still carry on a conversation without yelling. The food was wonderful. I highly recommend the mole with the flat iron steak.</p>

<p>The cocktails were fantastic, too. I kept with the Mexican theme and had a margarita and followed that up with a paloma. The paloma was perfection.</p>

<blockquote><p>Anthony Bourdain said, “I would like people really to pay more for top-quality Mexican food. I think it's the most undervalued, underappreciated world cuisine with tremendous, tremendous potential.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I think he’d be pleased with Cosme.</p>

<p>Verdict: If you find yourself in NYC with a group of friends, go here.</p>

      <h2>The Quest</h2>

      <p>In 2018, shortly after my 44th birthday, I set myself a goal to visit 50 of the 
        World's 50 Best Restaurants before I turn 50.</p> 
      <p>A new list comes out every year, with new restaurants added to the list and some restaurants falling off the list. I can visit any restaurant that was on the list between 2017 and 2022. </p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>I love to travel and I love great food. The list provides an excuse to travel to new places around the world all while enjoying some of the best food on the planet.</p>
