<p>Dinner by Heston Blumenthal (DHB) didn’t end up being the experience I wanted or hoped for. The menu pulls from recipes as old as the 1300s. A tasting menu over the course of many centuries sounded like a delight. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, those accompanying me for the meal were pescatarian and the restaurant didn’t allow any changes to their tasting menu. As a result, we had to pick from the a la carte menu. This was a bit surprising since any restaurant we’ve been to so far has been willing to work around any requests. </p>

<p>For a starter, I had the Rice &amp; Flesh. This was one of the oldest recipes on the menu dating back to 1390. It was warm and rich. </p>

<p>For my main, I went with the Hereford fillet with triple cooked fries. The steak was perfection. The fries were perfection. It came with a mushroom ketchup that was fantastic. It still doesn’t beat a Kobe steak but it was probably within the top 10 steaks I’ve ever had. </p>

<p>Lastly, for dessert, I had a delicious Sambocade. A sambocade is like a light fluffy cheesecake with some fruit inside of it. It was a perfect end to a lovely evening.</p>

<p>The meal was wonderful. But I would definitely like to return to properly try the tasting menu. There <em>is</em> an option to book a seat within the kitchen and be served by the chef. The next time I head to London, I’ll have to see if I can have this experience.</p>
