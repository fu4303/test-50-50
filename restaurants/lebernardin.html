<p>Le Bernardin was good but a bit of a rocky start upon our arrival. Despite the 33ºC heat with untold humidity, I was told by no less than three different people from the front door to my seat to put my jacket on. (It’s the only place I’ve been to that has such strict rules about jackets.)</p>

<p>Each of the dishes were tasty but didn’t seem to be pushing any boundaries or presenting any surprises. The wine pairings were nicely done, all complimenting the dishes. Le Bernardin has knowledgeable sommeliers wearing tastevins (a silver cup) around their neck. (Okay, maybe a little pretentious but considering the jacket requirement, I suppose this shouldn’t come as a surprise.)</p>

<p>The service fell off towards the end of the meal. They asked if I wanted a coffee and I said yes to an espresso. They brought it out and then also brought out petit fours and a dessert wine. I consider the espresso the end-of-the-meal drink and was surprised to have more. We were also left waiting for our bill.</p>

<p>Verdict: If you’re a fan of good wine and good food, you won’t be disappointed but I probably wouldn’t plan a cross-country trip to go here.</p>
