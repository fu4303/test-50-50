<p>Cosme serves up “fresh Mexican cuisine from one of the hottest young chefs in the US”, Daniela Soto-Innes.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of tasting menus where everything is decided for you—including the drink pairing. Cosme only does a la carte small plates, so I was overwhelmed with what to choose. If you can go as a group of four, I think that’d be ideal. That way, everybody can order a couple different things and share.</p>

<p>Even still, Cosme was wonderful. The place was busy but you can still carry on a conversation without yelling. The food was wonderful. I highly recommend the mole with the flat iron steak.</p>

<p>The cocktails were fantastic, too. I kept with the Mexican theme and had a margarita and followed that up with a paloma. The paloma was perfection.</p>

<blockquote><p>Anthony Bourdain said, “I would like people really to pay more for top-quality Mexican food. I think it's the most undervalued, underappreciated world cuisine with tremendous, tremendous potential.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I think he’d be pleased with Cosme.</p>

<p>Verdict: If you find yourself in NYC with a group of friends, go here.</p>
