<p>I feel like an addict seeking desperately for his next fix. Each restaurant I go to, I wonder how many of those Ratatouille moments will hit me.  </p>

<hr>

<p>We arrive at <a href="http://www.quintonil.com/en/">Quintonil</a>, just as it opens, and are quickly taken to our seats. The decor is simple, with maybe a dozen tables in the restaurant. Our table is right at the back, near the entrance to the kitchen. Sadly, without a view of the frenetic dance that I envision behind. Throughout the evening, the servers are in and out like bees to a hive.  </p>

<p>I have a view of the bar. I can see the wine glasses being lined up, the next bottle being prepared. The style of glass provides a hint of the next dish to come.  </p>

<p>The food was delightful. There were some unexpected surprises in the bunch that stood out. Like a nixtamalized tomato that tasted warm and rich instead of cool and acidic. (Today I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization">nixtamalization</a>.) The bread was probably the best bread I’ve ever had, with a crust that was crunchy but not too thick, and a butter that disappeared way too quickly. (Thankfully, they brought more.)  </p>

<p>We were delighted and intrigued by the avocado tartare with escamoles. It had a wonderful contrast in textures and a “grain” that we couldn’t figure out what it was. Which leads me to another “today I learned,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escamol">escamoles</a> are the edible larvae and pupae of ants. As Wikipedia says, “they taste buttery and nutty.” It’s probably for the best I didn’t know that at the time. </p>

<p>My favourite dish of the evening was the pork in chile pasado. It was flavourful and balanced. 
Another dish that I really liked was the Jerusalem artichoke tamale.  </p>

<p>My favourite dessert was the Sapodilla fruit rocks. It was such a new flavour that every bite was savoured.  </p>

  <figcaption>This Mexican wine had a hilarious label. The alcohol pairings were a nice mix of Mexican and from around the world.</figcaption>

<p>The alcohol pairings were quite good. Every drink, with the exception of one, paired extremely well. A particular standout was a Mexican beer, Finisima. It had a Belgian quality that was smooth and easy to drink. We also had an “orange” wine from the country of Georgia. Yet another “today I learned,” <a href="https://winefolly.com/review/orange-wine/">orange wine</a> isn’t made from oranges.  </p>

<p>Not every dish was spectacular. The ceviche was a tad too citrusy. And there was a potato dish that was fine but a bit bland. The menu says it was supposed to be fish, so I suspect there wasn’t any good fish available that evening. These dishes were still a 7/10, so it’s not like I still didn’t enjoy them. </p>

<p>All in all, it was a wonderful evening. If you find yourself in Mexico City, I highly recommend spending an evening here. With the currency exchange right now, it’s an exceptional value.</p>
