<p>With the three day trip to Paris coming to a close with our fourth restaurant, Astrance hit the spot feeling upscale and, yet, laid back.</p>

<p>The evening featured a tasting menu <em>avec les vins surprise</em>. That is, instead of presenting and describing the wine when it is served, it was described after it and the dish were finished. It was a fun twist and, for those with a finer palate than mine, likely an amusing experience in trying to guess the wine. My palate is nowhere that refined.</p>

<h3>The Meal</h3>

<p>The evening started off with a lovely amuse-bouche of a tomato and apple tart followed by a fascinating cheese and sun-dried tomato dish. The texture of the cheese was like a firm slice of gummy American cheese. Tasty, nonetheless.</p>

<p>After that was a mussel ceviche with a basil coconut lime sauce. It had hints of a ceviche but the lettuce wasn’t the right texture to elevate the dish. Still, tasty.</p>

<p>Next up was a turbot with sushi rice and soy-based sauce. This was a yummy dish. The fish was cooked exceptionally well and the rice had a lot of flavour that worked by itself or with the rest of the dish. Dare I say it? It was tasty.</p>

<p>The fish was followed by two meat courses: a succulent chicken medallion, and breast of pigeon on white beans served with a side of leg topped with a foie gras biscuit. I never say no to foie gras.</p>

<p>As we transition into the desserts, we start off with a mashed potato yoghurt ice cream. I was skeptical for reasons I don’t know why. It was quite delicious. </p>

<p>There was a walnut roasted in cognac with coffee ice cream. A cream tower of pears, plums, and figs. Egg foam. Madelines. And a plate of fruit.</p>

<p>The whole “cut off the top of the egg and then fill it with something” is a common sight amongst high end restaurants. I appreciate it for what it is and at the same time, it is starting to feel rather common. I won’t knock a restaurant for having it on the menu, though.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>It was a great meal to end on. It wasn’t overwhelmingly large like some meals we’ve had. The food was delicious. The service was jovial. I enjoyed the wine pairings and I liked the surprise reveal after every course. I’m surprised to see it fall off the Top 50 list and to have lost a Michelin star. The meal choreography was top notch and I think the overall experience exceeded other restaurants we’ve been to. I imagine Paris being a very competitive city when it comes to high-end French cuisine and Astrance stepped up. </p>
