<p>I’m in London for a week before a conference and I’ve managed to book reservations at all four of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants that are here. Then the worst happens: I come down with a cold right before everything.</p>

<p>I’ve flown over an ocean and spent a lot of money to be here and don’t want to miss out on this opportunity. I get as much rest as I can, skipping out on any sightseeing to make sure I’m in good enough shape for dinner. Evening comes and I’m feeling good enough to venture out. </p>

<p>Dinner comes and we’re one of the first people at the restaurant. We’re in a room with about a dozen tables and with full view of the kitchen. I’m impressed at how much work is done in a rather small space. (Small kitchens are something we’ll discover is rather common among the London restaurants.)</p>

<p>I’m full in with the usual wine pairings, starting off with a decent sparkling wine to start. Sadly, I’m writing this up well after the fact and have since forgotten the quality of the wine pairings. I really should write this stuff down at the time. On the flip side, our sommelier was the spitting image of British comedian, Michael McIntyre, and made for an amusing evening.</p>

<p>A small collection of appetizers come out to start the meal. A crab cream in a cracker, a small bite of fish on a seaweed cracker, and a delightfully yummy fried chicken bite. To end the collection, was a breaded ball of haggis. It didn’t have the strong peppery punch that the haggis I had in Edinburgh. Still tasty, though. </p>

<p>A beet creme dish acts as a palette cleanser as we go into a series of fish dishes. A salmon tartar in a cream sauce topped with caviar. A scallop topped with truffle and mushrooms. A sardine on a cracker that was phenomenal and one of the best dishes of the evening. There was another fish dish served with a number of mushroom sauces. </p>

<p>Next up was a quartet of beef dishes. A smoked beef venison served into a smoking glass jar. On the plate was venison served with white truffle. I know many people love truffle but I don’t find it adds much to the dish.</p>

<p>There last two mains were pork. One served three ways with a beet sauce. The other crispy pork belly tacos. Soooo good.</p>

<p>After a lovely sorbet to, once again, cleanse the palette, we had a wonderful piece of apple pie with a madeira pairing. If I recall correctly, it was the same one we had at Saison. A great choice!</p>

<p>At the beginning of the meal, we had made mention to our waiter that we were in the midst of this crazy adventure. To end the evening, he offered us a chance to have a picture with the chef (and one of the owners), Isaac McHale. </p>

<p>McHale was very amiable and very giving of his time, continuing the conversation for some time. (McHale is Scottish, which explains the haggis “doughnuts”.)</p>

<p>The entire evening was delightful and can highly recommend coming here. </p>
