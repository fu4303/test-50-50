  <p>Saison was the very first restaurant on the quest. It was ranked 37th in 2017 and dropped to 46th in 2018. It’s also a Michelin 3-star restaurant.</p>
</div>

<p>We went to Saison before I had even thought to do this wacky challenge. At the time, I booked all four Michelin 3-star restaurants in San Francisco. All within the same week. It was an ambitious endeavour and clearly set the tone for the even bigger challenge that awaited me.</p>

<p>Saison was the second of the four restaurants featuring an eleven course meal only a day after a nine course meal at Benu. (My ideas aren’t always the brightest but they can be ambitious.)</p>

<p>We sat “in the kitchen”, which meant that we had a view of the kitchen, could see all the preparation, and could hear them yell “Yes, Chef” every time a new order came in. It was quite delightful.</p>

<p>We noticed some overlap with the menu at Benu: the cod, some sea urchin, and, a glazed barbecued quail. There was a caviar option that I opted into that was a bit heavy on the butter (if there can be such a thing).</p>

<p>The antelope was also quite delicious, much like the rest of the meal. All in all, everything was wonderful. (And if I had to choose, I’d pick Saison over Benu.)</p>

      <h2>The Quest</h2>

      <p>In 2018, shortly after my 44th birthday, I set myself a goal to visit 50 of the 
        World's 50 Best Restaurants before I turn 50.</p> 
      <p>A new list comes out every year, with new restaurants added to the list and some restaurants falling off the list. I can visit any restaurant that was on the list between 2017 and 2022. </p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>I love to travel and I love great food. The list provides an excuse to travel to new places around the world all while enjoying some of the best food on the planet.</p>
