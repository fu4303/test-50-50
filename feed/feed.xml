&lt;p&gt;We went to Saison before I had even thought to do this wacky challenge. At the time, I booked all four Michelin 3-star restaurants in San Francisco. All within the same week. It was an ambitious endeavour and clearly set the tone for the even bigger challenge that awaited me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saison was the second of the four restaurants featuring an eleven course meal only a day after a nine course meal at Benu. (My ideas aren’t always the brightest but they can be ambitious.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat “in the kitchen”, which meant that we had a view of the kitchen, could see all the preparation, and could hear them yell “Yes, Chef” every time a new order came in. It was quite delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We noticed some overlap with the menu at Benu: the cod, some sea urchin, and, a glazed barbecued quail. There was a caviar option that I opted into that was a bit heavy on the butter (if there can be such a thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antelope was also quite delicious, much like the rest of the meal. All in all, everything was wonderful. (And if I had to choose, I’d pick Saison over Benu.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 50 Before 50 Challenge continues. This time, in Chicago for the fifth of fifty restaurants. I flew in just for this, arriving the morning of the reservation and leaving the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were very specific about not arriving late, so as not to miss any of &lt;em&gt;the show&lt;/em&gt;. We arrived a half hour early, rain beginning to come down. There’s no bar at the restaurant. We walked two doors down to an Italian restaurant that had a fantastic selection of tasty martinis, if you’re looking to kill a bit of time before your meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Alinea, much of the enjoyment comes from the experience. This started from the moment we walked through the front door. We ascended the stairs to the second floor and I was delighted by the smell. It was fragrant and slightly citrusy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the meal. Like Librije’s Zusje in Amsterdam, a bit of theatrics was in store throughout the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bowl of salt was lit on fire at one point with embers on top. Later it was revealed that a baked potato lay underneath and was one of the dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At another point, we were all led to the kitchen to be presented with a root beer style cocktail and a pizza pocket inspired dish. (Both were delicious.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food throughout was quite good. The starting dish was a bouquet of flowers that was very tasty. It was paired with a bowl of caviar on cream. The caviar was okay but didn’t compare to some I’ve had elsewhere. (The best I’ve had so far was at Quince in San Francisco.) My favourite dish was probably the spanner crab, followed by the octopus. The rest was wonderful but not transcendental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flickr.com/photos/53573449@N00/sets/72157672186919598&quot;&gt;View photos of the trip on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the wine pairing and they did a wonderful job. There was a bit of surprise when they brought out a red wine in between a couple whites. Normally, restaurants start with a champagne and then switch to whites for the first few plates (that pair with the vegetable or fish dishes that normally come at the beginning of a multi-course meal like this). Finally, the last couple dishes with meatier plates will be paired with reds. (And lastly, something sweet to go along with dessert like a port or moscato.) I went out of my way to compliment the sommelier on the fine choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict:&lt;/em&gt; Worth travelling to. Food, wine, and experience come together for a wonderful evening. &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Geranium</title>

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is situated on the 8th floor of the building where the Danish national football club plays—an interesting location to be sure. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From the moment we walked in the restaurant, the service was fantastic and friendly. The kitchen prep area sits at one end of the venue and was neat to take a peek every now and then into what might be coming up next. (It’s a bit difficult to see from halfway across the restaurant. There is a table right next to the prep area that you can book.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snookca/image/upload/c_fill,h_496,w_1003/v1544557303/geranium/jvhpqk22bzgdqdum5oae.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The chefs working away in the common prep area&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The team of chefs working away on the upcoming meal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the meal, the servers really made us feel special. I enjoyed their synchronicity with dish placement and I definitely enjoyed them topping up my glass of wine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I find wine pairings to be confusing. Some places will do a glass with each course. I like to enjoy the particular wine before, during, and after the particular dish it’s paired with. Some places, however, will pair a wine with two to three courses. As such, I’ll finish the wine after a dish, only to have another plate come out with no wine to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having them top up my glass is nice but I also don’t want to be completely sloshed and stumbling a third of the way into the meal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food itself was delightfully yummy. There wasn’t a bad dish to be had. The courses were mostly pescatarian, with a single duck course at the end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not a single dish made the world disappear as my entire life became about this food in my mouth at that very moment. The best way to describe it is that every dish is a 9/10. A perfectly formidable rating but nothing was a 10 out of 10. Consistent and delicious but not daring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict:&lt;/em&gt; I think there are other places I’d seek out before Geranium. It’s definitely on the pricey side but, at the same time, it was a wonderful experience and I don’t think you’d be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I want their wine cellar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relae was a more relaxed and intimate vibe than &lt;a href=&quot;https://snook.ca/archives/food/geranium&quot;&gt;Geranium&lt;/a&gt;. We were placed at the bar at the edge of the kitchen—an ideal spot to watch everything going on, including the two chefs prepping right in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snookca/image/upload/c_fill,h_496,w_1003/v1544027371/relae/IMG_20181124_193504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view of the kitchen where we could see the chefs prepare the food.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The chef working away on a dish right in front of us.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the chill environment with soft funk music playing throughout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant offers a short and long menu and of course I went with the long menu. I went with the wine pairings while Kitt went for the juice pairings. Ever since I had a juice pairing at &lt;a href=&quot;http://koks.fo/en/&quot;&gt;KOKS&lt;/a&gt;, I’m always delighted to see it at other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The courses came out in staccato, creating a very jazzy feel to the presentation. Different chefs and servers would show up to present and talk about a particular dish. We didn’t feel rushed. Rather, we were delighted by the slightly frenetic feel of the evening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Geranium, the meal was almost entirely pescatarian save for one duck course. (Well, maybe you’d consider it two courses since it was two dishes served at the same time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite trio of courses was the seafood: squid followed by a bbq trout followed by a deep fried oyster. The BBQ trout, in particular was absolutely succulent and filled me with delight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in Copenhagen, I highly recommend you find your way here. It&#39;s not too expensive, the food is fantastic, as is the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like an addict seeking desperately for his next fix. Each restaurant I go to, I wonder how many of those Ratatouille moments will hit me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrive at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quintonil.com/en/&quot;&gt;Quintonil&lt;/a&gt;, just as it opens, and are quickly taken to our seats. The decor is simple, with maybe a dozen tables in the restaurant. Our table is right at the back, near the entrance to the kitchen. Sadly, without a view of the frenetic dance that I envision behind. Throughout the evening, the servers are in and out like bees to a hive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a view of the bar. I can see the wine glasses being lined up, the next bottle being prepared. The style of glass provides a hint of the next dish to come.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food was delightful. There were some unexpected surprises in the bunch that stood out. Like a nixtamalized tomato that tasted warm and rich instead of cool and acidic. (Today I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization&quot;&gt;nixtamalization&lt;/a&gt;.) The bread was probably the best bread I’ve ever had, with a crust that was crunchy but not too thick, and a butter that disappeared way too quickly. (Thankfully, they brought more.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were delighted and intrigued by the avocado tartare with escamoles. It had a wonderful contrast in textures and a “grain” that we couldn’t figure out what it was. Which leads me to another “today I learned,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escamol&quot;&gt;escamoles&lt;/a&gt; are the edible larvae and pupae of ants. As Wikipedia says, “they taste buttery and nutty.” It’s probably for the best I didn’t know that at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite dish of the evening was the pork in chile pasado. It was flavourful and balanced. 
Another dish that I really liked was the Jerusalem artichoke tamale.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite dessert was the Sapodilla fruit rocks. It was such a new flavour that every bite was savoured.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alcohol pairings were quite good. Every drink, with the exception of one, paired extremely well. A particular standout was a Mexican beer, Finisima. It had a Belgian quality that was smooth and easy to drink. We also had an “orange” wine from the country of Georgia. Yet another “today I learned,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://winefolly.com/review/orange-wine/&quot;&gt;orange wine&lt;/a&gt; isn’t made from oranges.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every dish was spectacular. The ceviche was a tad too citrusy. And there was a potato dish that was fine but a bit bland. The menu says it was supposed to be fish, so I suspect there wasn’t any good fish available that evening. These dishes were still a 7/10, so it’s not like I still didn’t enjoy them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a wonderful evening. If you find yourself in Mexico City, I highly recommend spending an evening here. With the currency exchange right now, it’s an exceptional value.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Quick on the heels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://50by50.snook.ca/restaurants/quintonil/&quot;&gt;Quintonil&lt;/a&gt;, was a popover to Pujol. They &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in the same city, after all. The two restaurants are merely blocks away from each other. And fun fact, the husband and wife team that own Quintonil used to work at Pujol. &lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;I signed us up for the omakase taco experience. For those not familiar with omakase, it’s a “chef’s choice” experience often found at sushi restaurants. (Speaking of, the omakase experience at Bamboo Sushi in Portland, Oregon, is fantastic.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We arrived and were seated at the bar in the middle of a string of people also there to take in the tacos. There’s plenty of table space throughout the restaurant with a more traditional tasting menu. This omakase experience is its own thing and definitely felt Japanese-inspired. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;With the dinner were three alcohol pairing choices: mexican beer, mezcal, or sake. (See? There’s that Japanese influence.) Having never tried much mezcal, I was excited to try it and what better way than to have a glass with each course!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The corn-themed evening kicked off with a trio of “street snacks” that included baby corn, a puffed corn tortilla with caviar and cream, and (if I recall correctly) a tofu paste. My descriptions are not doing any of these justice. I was floored but how amazing it was and had me excited for the rest to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Next up was a tetela—a corn triangle—filled with beans with an uni salsa to top. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;From there, we moved through a series of taco courses: Eggplant, then amberjack, a scallop tostada, a seabass belly taco al pastor, and finally, a soft-shell crab taco. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think the amberjack and the seabass were my favourites of the bunch. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Then, the pièce de résistance: the Mole Madre. I watched chef Enrique Olvera featured on Chef’s Table and in it they talked of this mole, a sauce cooked for over a year. Since that show has aired, it has continued to cook. On this evening, it had been 1762 days. That’s nearly five years! &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The mole madre is served with a mole nuevo in the middle, allowing a contrast between the old and the new. And let me just say that it did not disappoint. I would bathe in this, it was so good. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Alas, all good things must come to an end. This meal came to a close with a trio of desserts and a final churro. It was probably the best churro I’ve had, with a crunchiness and tasty balance that wasn’t too sweet or too cinnamon. (I was told to try churros at &lt;a href=&quot;http://elmoro.mx/&quot;&gt;El Moro&lt;/a&gt; but didn’t have a chance to get there. A reason to go back!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mexico City didn’t disappoint. &lt;/p&gt;
