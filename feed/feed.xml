&lt;p&gt;We went to Saison before I had even thought to do this wacky challenge. At the time, I booked all four Michelin 3-star restaurants in San Francisco. All within the same week. It was an ambitious endeavour and clearly set the tone for the even bigger challenge that awaited me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saison was the second of the four restaurants featuring an eleven course meal only a day after a nine course meal at Benu. (My ideas aren’t always the brightest but they can be ambitious.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat “in the kitchen”, which meant that we had a view of the kitchen, could see all the preparation, and could hear them yell “Yes, Chef” every time a new order came in. It was quite delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We noticed some overlap with the menu at Benu: the cod, some sea urchin, and, a glazed barbecued quail. There was a caviar option that I opted into that was a bit heavy on the butter (if there can be such a thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antelope was also quite delicious, much like the rest of the meal. All in all, everything was wonderful. (And if I had to choose, I’d pick Saison over Benu.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Cosme serves up “fresh Mexican cuisine from one of the hottest young chefs in the US”, Daniela Soto-Innes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of tasting menus where everything is decided for you—including the drink pairing. Cosme only does a la carte small plates, so I was overwhelmed with what to choose. If you can go as a group of four, I think that’d be ideal. That way, everybody can order a couple different things and share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even still, Cosme was wonderful. The place was busy but you can still carry on a conversation without yelling. The food was wonderful. I highly recommend the mole with the flat iron steak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cocktails were fantastic, too. I kept with the Mexican theme and had a margarita and followed that up with a paloma. The paloma was perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Bourdain said, “I would like people really to pay more for top-quality Mexican food. I think it&#39;s the most undervalued, underappreciated world cuisine with tremendous, tremendous potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he’d be pleased with Cosme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdict: If you find yourself in NYC with a group of friends, go here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, getting reservations means planning ahead. Reservations for a given month open up on the 1st of the previous month. For our July reservation, we booked June 1st. The rest of the restaurants were planned around this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service from the moment we walked in the door was fantastic. Our host was cheerful and friendly throughout the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food. Oh my god, the food. The meal was incredible. I was nearly to tears with how good the food was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the dishes have a seasonal twist on them. Being in the thick of summer, corn was a common thread through some of the courses. Caviar served on top of a corn soufflé with a cream sauce, for example, was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chef Daniel Humm himself said, “The duck is probably the only recipe that I feel I have perfected fully.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was fantastic. I highly recommend choosing the duck option, if you have the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far my favourite dish was the foie gras. Absolute perfection. Each bite was bliss and I savoured it through and through. Nothing I’ve had before or since compares to this dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other interesting tidbit was that we prepaid for our meal when we made the booking. This actually made the end of the meal quite pleasant. There was nothing to sign and no large bill to pretend wasn’t some insanely large amount. It also meant not feeling uncomfortable about how much to tip. I wish more restaurants did this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdict: Worth it. I will fly around the world to go here.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Le Bernardin</title>

		<content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;New York in the middle of summer. A stifling 33ºC heat with a short subway ride from the Flatiron almost to Central Park. Le Bernardin&#39;s dress code says &lt;em&gt;jacket required&lt;/em&gt;. I have my jacket draped over my arm to prevent myself from showing up at the front door as a puddle of sweat. The humidity was thick with a thunderstorm looming. Sure enough, as we exit the subway station and head towards the restaurant, the sky opens up. Less than ideal conditions but at least a tasty meal awaits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walk through the door and tell the maître d’ that we have a reservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure thing. If you could just put on your jacket, sir. Well, it is hot, we’ll give you a few minutes to cool down. Then please put on your jacket.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a big deal. I knew about the jacket requirement. We are escorted to our table. On our way, a server informs me that I must put on my jacket. “Yeah, I know,” I think to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are seated, our waiter for this lunch-time meal also informs me of my need to put on my jacket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not off to a great start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food, however, didn’t disappoint. Each of the French-style dishes were tasty but didn’t seem to be pushing any boundaries or presenting any surprises. It’s what one might expect when they think of what a Michelin 3-star restaurant experience should be like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wine pairings were nicely done, all complimenting the dishes. Le Bernardin has knowledgeable sommeliers wearing tastevins (a silver cup) around their neck. (Okay, maybe a little pretentious but considering the jacket requirement, I suppose this shouldn’t come as a surprise.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service fell off towards the end of the meal. As the restaurant filled with patrons, the servers for our table didn’t come by as often and there was more time between each of the dishes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked if I wanted a coffee and I said yes to an espresso. I consider the espresso the end-of-the-meal drink. It’s usually the last thing had while the bill is signed. But served with the espresso was the final dessert of petit fours and a dessert wine. A bit surprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very end, we were left waiting for our bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected more out of the experience and after &lt;a href=&quot;https://fifty.snook.ca/restaurants/eleven/&quot;&gt;Eleven&lt;/a&gt; the night before, I definitely left Le Bernardin disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 50 Before 50 Challenge continues. This time, in Chicago for the fifth of fifty restaurants. I flew in just for this, arriving the morning of the reservation and leaving the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were very specific about not arriving late, so as not to miss any of &lt;em&gt;the show&lt;/em&gt;. We arrived a half hour early, rain beginning to come down. There’s no bar at the restaurant. We walked two doors down to an Italian restaurant that had a fantastic selection of tasty martinis, if you’re looking to kill a bit of time before your meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Alinea, much of the enjoyment comes from the experience. This started from the moment we walked through the front door. We ascended the stairs to the second floor and I was delighted by the smell. It was fragrant and slightly citrusy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff was friendly and helpful throughout the meal. Like Librije’s Zusje in Amsterdam, a bit of theatrics was in store throughout the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bowl of salt was lit on fire at one point with embers on top. Later it was revealed that a baked potato lay underneath and was one of the dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At another point, we were all led to the kitchen to be presented with a root beer style cocktail and a pizza pocket inspired dish. (Both were delicious.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food throughout was quite good. The starting dish was a bouquet of flowers that was very tasty. It was paired with a bowl of caviar on cream. The caviar was okay but didn’t compare to some I’ve had elsewhere. (The best I’ve had so far was at Quince in San Francisco.) My favourite dish was probably the spanner crab, followed by the octopus. The rest was wonderful but not transcendental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flickr.com/photos/53573449@N00/sets/72157672186919598&quot;&gt;View photos of the trip on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the wine pairing and they did a wonderful job. There was a bit of surprise when they brought out a red wine in between a couple whites. Normally, restaurants start with a champagne and then switch to whites for the first few plates (that pair with the vegetable or fish dishes that normally come at the beginning of a multi-course meal like this). Finally, the last couple dishes with meatier plates will be paired with reds. (And lastly, something sweet to go along with dessert like a port or moscato.) I went out of my way to compliment the sommelier on the fine choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict:&lt;/em&gt; Worth travelling to. Food, wine, and experience come together for a wonderful evening. &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Geranium</title>

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is situated on the 8th floor of the building where the Danish national football club plays—an interesting location to be sure. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From the moment we walked in the restaurant, the service was fantastic and friendly. The kitchen prep area sits at one end of the venue and was neat to take a peek every now and then into what might be coming up next. (It’s a bit difficult to see from halfway across the restaurant. There is a table right next to the prep area that you can book.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snookca/image/upload/c_fill,h_496,w_1003/v1544557303/geranium/jvhpqk22bzgdqdum5oae.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The chefs working away in the common prep area&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The team of chefs working away on the upcoming meal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the meal, the servers really made us feel special. I enjoyed their synchronicity with dish placement and I definitely enjoyed them topping up my glass of wine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I find wine pairings to be confusing. Some places will do a glass with each course. I like to enjoy the particular wine before, during, and after the particular dish it’s paired with. Some places, however, will pair a wine with two to three courses. As such, I’ll finish the wine after a dish, only to have another plate come out with no wine to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having them top up my glass is nice but I also don’t want to be completely sloshed and stumbling a third of the way into the meal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food itself was delightfully yummy. There wasn’t a bad dish to be had. The courses were mostly pescatarian, with a single duck course at the end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not a single dish made the world disappear as my entire life became about this food in my mouth at that very moment. The best way to describe it is that every dish is a 9/10. A perfectly formidable rating but nothing was a 10 out of 10. Consistent and delicious but not daring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verdict:&lt;/em&gt; I think there are other places I’d seek out before Geranium. It’s definitely on the pricey side but, at the same time, it was a wonderful experience and I don’t think you’d be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I want their wine cellar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relae was a more relaxed and intimate vibe than &lt;a href=&quot;https://fifty.snook.ca/restaurants/geranium/&quot;&gt;Geranium&lt;/a&gt;. We were placed at the bar at the edge of the kitchen—an ideal spot to watch everything going on, including the two chefs prepping right in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snookca/image/upload/c_fill,h_496,w_1003/v1544027371/relae/IMG_20181124_193504.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view of the kitchen where we could see the chefs prepare the food.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The chef working away on a dish right in front of us.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the chill environment with soft funk music playing throughout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant offers a short and long menu and of course I went with the long menu. I went with the wine pairings while Kitt went for the juice pairings. Ever since I had a juice pairing at &lt;a href=&quot;http://koks.fo/en/&quot;&gt;KOKS&lt;/a&gt;, I’m always delighted to see it at other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The courses came out in staccato, creating a very jazzy feel to the presentation. Different chefs and servers would show up to present and talk about a particular dish. We didn’t feel rushed. Rather, we were delighted by the slightly frenetic feel of the evening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Geranium, the meal was almost entirely pescatarian save for one duck course. (Well, maybe you’d consider it two courses since it was two dishes served at the same time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite trio of courses was the seafood: squid followed by a bbq trout followed by a deep fried oyster. The BBQ trout, in particular was absolutely succulent and filled me with delight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in Copenhagen, I highly recommend you find your way here. It&#39;s not too expensive, the food is fantastic, as is the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like an addict seeking desperately for his next fix. Each restaurant I go to, I wonder how many of those Ratatouille moments will hit me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrive at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quintonil.com/en/&quot;&gt;Quintonil&lt;/a&gt;, just as it opens, and are quickly taken to our seats. The decor is simple, with maybe a dozen tables in the restaurant. Our table is right at the back, near the entrance to the kitchen. Sadly, without a view of the frenetic dance that I envision behind. Throughout the evening, the servers are in and out like bees to a hive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a view of the bar. I can see the wine glasses being lined up, the next bottle being prepared. The style of glass provides a hint of the next dish to come.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food was delightful. There were some unexpected surprises in the bunch that stood out. Like a nixtamalized tomato that tasted warm and rich instead of cool and acidic. (Today I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization&quot;&gt;nixtamalization&lt;/a&gt;.) The bread was probably the best bread I’ve ever had, with a crust that was crunchy but not too thick, and a butter that disappeared way too quickly. (Thankfully, they brought more.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were delighted and intrigued by the avocado tartare with escamoles. It had a wonderful contrast in textures and a “grain” that we couldn’t figure out what it was. Which leads me to another “today I learned,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escamol&quot;&gt;escamoles&lt;/a&gt; are the edible larvae and pupae of ants. As Wikipedia says, “they taste buttery and nutty.” It’s probably for the best I didn’t know that at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite dish of the evening was the pork in chile pasado. It was flavourful and balanced. 
Another dish that I really liked was the Jerusalem artichoke tamale.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite dessert was the Sapodilla fruit rocks. It was such a new flavour that every bite was savoured.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/snookca/image/upload/c_fill,h_600,w_1003/v1546786341/quintonil/IMG_20181210_194731.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;No Sapiens Mexican wine&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;This Mexican wine had a hilarious label. The alcohol pairings were a nice mix of Mexican and from around the world.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The alcohol pairings were quite good. Every drink, with the exception of one, paired extremely well. A particular standout was a Mexican beer, Finisima. It had a Belgian quality that was smooth and easy to drink. We also had an “orange” wine from the country of Georgia. Yet another “today I learned,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://winefolly.com/review/orange-wine/&quot;&gt;orange wine&lt;/a&gt; isn’t made from oranges.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every dish was spectacular. The ceviche was a tad too citrusy. And there was a potato dish that was fine but a bit bland. The menu says it was supposed to be fish, so I suspect there wasn’t any good fish available that evening. These dishes were still a 7/10, so it’s not like I still didn’t enjoy them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a wonderful evening. If you find yourself in Mexico City, I highly recommend spending an evening here. With the currency exchange right now, it’s an exceptional value.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Quick on the heels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fifty.snook.ca/restaurants/quintonil/&quot;&gt;Quintonil&lt;/a&gt;, was a popover to Pujol. They &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in the same city, after all. The two restaurants are merely blocks away from each other. And fun fact, the husband and wife team that own Quintonil used to work at Pujol. &lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p&gt;I signed us up for the omakase taco experience. For those not familiar with omakase, it’s a “chef’s choice” experience often found at sushi restaurants. (Speaking of, the omakase experience at Bamboo Sushi in Portland, Oregon, is fantastic.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We arrived and were seated at the bar in the middle of a string of people also there to take in the tacos. There’s plenty of table space throughout the restaurant with a more traditional tasting menu. This omakase experience is its own thing and definitely felt Japanese-inspired. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;With the dinner were three alcohol pairing choices: mexican beer, mezcal, or sake. (See? There’s that Japanese influence.) Having never tried much mezcal, I was excited to try it and what better way than to have a glass with each course!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The corn-themed evening kicked off with a trio of “street snacks” that included baby corn, a puffed corn tortilla with caviar and cream, and (if I recall correctly) a tofu paste. My descriptions are not doing any of these justice. I was floored but how amazing it was and had me excited for the rest to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Next up was a tetela—a corn triangle—filled with beans with an uni salsa to top. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;From there, we moved through a series of taco courses: Eggplant, then amberjack, a scallop tostada, a seabass belly taco al pastor, and finally, a soft-shell crab taco. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I think the amberjack and the seabass were my favourites of the bunch. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Then, the pièce de résistance: the Mole Madre. I watched chef Enrique Olvera featured on Chef’s Table and in it they talked of this mole, a sauce cooked for over a year. Since that show has aired, it has continued to cook. On this evening, it had been 1762 days. That’s nearly five years! &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The mole madre is served with a mole nuevo in the middle, allowing a contrast between the old and the new. And let me just say that it did not disappoint. I would bathe in this, it was so good. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Alas, all good things must come to an end. This meal came to a close with a trio of desserts and a final churro. It was probably the best churro I’ve had, with a crunchiness and tasty balance that wasn’t too sweet or too cinnamon. (I was told to try churros at &lt;a href=&quot;http://elmoro.mx/&quot;&gt;El Moro&lt;/a&gt; but didn’t have a chance to get there. A reason to go back!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mexico City didn’t disappoint. &lt;/p&gt;
