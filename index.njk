<h1>The Quest</h1>
<p>There’s a scene in the movie, Ratatouille, where Anton Ego, the critical food critic, takes a bite of the titular dish. He is instantly transported to his childhood. There is something about being in that moment. It’s a moment I seek. The rest of world disappears. I can no longer hear. I can no longer see. All I can do is taste. And it is pure pleasure. </p>

<p>This journey will take me around the world, to visit 50 of the <a href="https://www.theworlds50best.com">World’s Best Restaurants</a>. I am no food critic. I have no sway. I’m just a guy who enjoys really good food and enjoys to travel. </p>

<p>I’ve put together some resources to help along the way. I have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NPckHqoxjhqoUIzrI2KSzU1AWeettEVEsykZYgUyd9w/edit?usp=sharing">list of all the restaurants</a>. Each year, a new list will come out and I will update this spreadsheet. </p>

<p>I’ve also put together maps showing where in the world each restaurant is. There is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q6WgxvPubRB7xNehdkfWg2qx1L0BMHR2&amp;usp=sharing">2017 Map</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wd5NYO4tqwTpxJD_eSr6Ke6hRrOwjH8y&amp;usp=sharing">2018 Map</a></p>

<p>What you’ll find here is a history of all the places I’ve been. </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>



<p>The journey so far...</p>
